### A drone flight simulator experience.

Pilot a DJI FPV drone through procedurally generated terrain with realistic physics and controls.

This project is a fork of the [Fly By](https://github.com/jessehhydee/fly-by) project, transforming the bird-flying experience into an immersive drone simulator.

### Features

- Realistic drone physics and controls
- Procedurally generated terrain with varying biomes
- First-person and third-person camera views
- Propeller animations with speed variations
- Drone tilt effects based on movement direction

### Demo
